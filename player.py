Player Module

This module defines the Player class for the Pitch card game, representing individual
players with comprehensive bidding and playing strategies. The module supports both
built-in strategies and external strategy modules, configurable player personalities
through aggressiveness and restraint parameters, and Excel-based bid strength
customization for advanced gameplay analysis.

Classes:
    Player: A comprehensive player class managing hand state, bidding logic, and
        multiple playing strategies with configurable behavior parameters.

Functions:
    get_args(): Parses command line arguments for player configuration and game modes.
    load_config(config_file): Loads YAML configuration files for player setup.
    configure_players(config, game_state): Creates player objects from configuration.
    main(): Demonstrates player functionality with bidding and hand management.

Module Constants:
    default_bid_strength (MappingProxyType): Immutable mapping of card ranks to their
        bidding strength values, with special handling for Pitch-specific cards like
        jacks and jokers.

class Player:
    """
    The Player class manages all aspects of gameplay including hand management,
    bidding with suit evaluation, trump selection, and multiple playing strategies.
    Supports both internal methods and external strategy modules, with configurable
    aggressiveness and restraint parameters affecting bidding behavior.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The display name of the player.
        position (int): The player's seat position (0-3) in a 4-player game.
        hand (Hand): The Hand object containing the player's current cards.
        bid_value (int): The numerical value of the player's current bid.
        bidding_suit (str): The trump suit the player would choose if they win the bid.
        strategies (dict): Configuration dictionary containing:
            - bid_strategy (callable): Function for making bids
            - play_strategy (callable): Function for selecting cards to play
            - aggressiveness (float): Added to computed bid values (default 0.0)
            - restraint (float): Subtracted from bids when partner is leading (default 0.0)
            - bid_strength (MappingProxyType): Mapping of card ranks to strength values
            - *_external (bool): Flags indicating if strategies are external modules

    Strategy Parameters:
        aggressiveness: Positive values increase bidding likelihood by adding to
            computed bid strength. Represents confidence in partner support and
            deck drawing luck.
        restraint: Positive values decrease bidding when partner leads, preventing
            overbidding. If computed bid minus restraint â‰¤ partner's bid, player passes.

            to ensure gameplay continues.

    Demonstrates comprehensive Player class functionality through simulated gameplay.
    
    This main function showcases the complete player workflow including command line
    argument processing, YAML configuration loading, dynamic player creation, and
    simulated bidding rounds with trump selection and hand management.

    Workflow:
        1. Parses command line arguments for game configuration
        2. Loads optional YAML configuration file for player setup
        3. Creates game state dictionary from command line flags
        4. Configures four players using dynamic module loading
        5. Simulates specified number of hands with:
           - Deck creation, reset, and shuffling
           - Hand dealing (9 cards per player)
           - Player bidding with strategy application
           - Trump selection and hand sorting
           - Non-trump card discarding
           - Hand refilling to 6 cards from deck
           - Final trump-only hand display

    Features Demonstrated:
        - Command line argument integration
        - YAML configuration file processing
        - Dynamic player class instantiation
        - Strategy pattern implementation
        - Bidding logic with personality factors
        - Trump-based card filtering and hand management
        - Interactive mode for step-by-step review

    Output:
        Displays round separators, initial hands, bidding results with chosen
        trump suits, trump-only hands after discarding, and final hands after
        deck drawing. Verbose mode shows detailed player configurations.
